This file was created on June 26th when I re-organized my directories to store my results in a more intuitive way.
This .txt file briefly explains each source of data which corresponds to a single sub-directory in this folder
Each csv is named after the date it was generated

cthru_expenditures: dataset on cthru called "Comptroller of the Commonwealth Spending"
https://cthru.data.socrata.com/dataset/Comptroller-of-the-Commonwealth-Spending/pegc-naaa
Has line-items of spending broken down by fiscal year, state agency etc

cthru_budgets: dataset on cthru called Budget_Actual_With_Other_Spending_Authorizationv3
https://cthru.data.socrata.com/dataset/Budget_Actual_With_Other_Spending_Authorizationv3/fmz7-6ft9
Has line items of induviudal approporations for spending, how much was budgerted, how much was actually spent, etc

cthru_payroll: dataset on cthru called Commonwealth of Massachusetts Payroll V2
https://cthru.data.socrata.com/dataset/Commonwealth-Of-Massachusetts-Payrollv2/rxhc-k6iz
Has line items of payroll paid to individual employees of different state agencies
I made two csv's on June 22nd, one that has all payroll types (base, OT, bonuses, buyout, total) and one that just has OT and total

boston_operating_budget: dataset on Boston's Office of Budget Management site called Operating Budget
https://data.boston.gov/dataset/operating-budget
Has only expenditures for 2018, 2019 and expected spending for 2020. Not great, will hopefully be replaced by data
from pdf's

revere_mayors_office: group of pdf's downloaded from https://www.revere.org/mayors-office#annual-budgets
Each year has an adopted and recommended category. For a given year the "recommended" number is
the "Mayor's Recommendation"which I took to mean the final proposal based on the way the budget is laid out.
There is more historic data on expenditures but that data isn't easily broken down into payroll, OT so I left it alone
The "Overtime" category is unclear to me, there is an "Overtime" line item and then also a "Overtime Sub-Total" line-item
that includes categories of overtime, quinn overtime, Court Time, and Election detail. I took the smaller single
"Overtime" line-item

chelsea_city_auditor: two pdfs,  2020 and 2021 annual budgets from
https://www.chelseama.gov/city-auditor/pages/financial-documents-reports
For the 2020 budget it only has a "budget" column for each year. The budget number for 2020 in the FY20 document
matches the 2020 "adopted budget" in the FY21 document, so I call numbers from 2020 document "adopted budget"
For 2021, I use the typical "Actual" is called "expenditures" convention
For each year, the total amount budgeted for the cops is the same so I can't use the same methodology I used for
revere. It says "expenditures" in the pdf by each year's budget has a number for that year. For example in 2020 we don't know
total expendtiures in 2020 because the fiscal year hasn't ended yet. So I just call all these numbers "budget"


boston_budget_pdfs: pdf's from https://www.boston.gov/departments/budget
This has more information than the API they have up, but information will be harder to get to
This information is more rich than revere or chelsea budgets. There is expenditures for two years prior, appropriated
for prior year, and adopted for current year which I call budget
The budget also has "external funds" not sure what that means so I left it out

winthrop_budget_pdfs: pdf's from https://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/town-managers-office/pages/previous-years-budgets
and 2021 proposed budget from https://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/town-managers-office/pages/fy2021-proposed-budget
Instead of Expenditure, Appropriations, and request/budget there is actual, budget, and request but they follow the same
pattern as Boston where each year's budget has actual/expenditures for 2 and 3 years prior, appropriated/budgeted for prior
year, and adopted/recommended for current year
Note that the 2018 budget doesn't have a section for public safety, and I couldn't find the 2020 budget
