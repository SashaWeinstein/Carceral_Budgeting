Explanation of methodology as of July 28th for DOC pensions.
The DOC pension data is misclassified in a serious way that I hadn't seen before at this point in the project.
The yearly pension payments I could find are quite low, around 11 million a year 2011-2019. Compare to state police,
which has a budget around 2/3rds as big but 99-130 mil per year in pension payments from 2016-2020.
But there are 160 million dollars in pension payments to DOC employees all in 2020. So I took the % of total pension costs
(not counting that lump sum obviously) per year from 2011-2020 and split the lump sum according to those proportions.
